# Testcase Example:  '[2,2,1]'
#
# Given a non-emptyÂ array of integers, every element appears twice except for
# one. Find that single one.
# 
# Note:
# 
# Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement
# it without using extra memory?
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,2,1]
# Output: 1

# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
# Output: 4

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        for val in nums:
            result ^= val
        return result
